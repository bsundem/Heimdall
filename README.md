A Great Bridge Shall Open The Way

# Data Analytics Application Architecture Design Document

## 1. Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, plugin-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. The design aligns with SOLID principles and enables both UI-based and headless operation modes.

└── plugins/        # Domain-specific plugins
```

## 2. Key Design Principles

### 2.1 SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through plugins without modifying core code
- **Liskov Substitution**: Base classes and interfaces with proper inheritance
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused interfaces for specific use cases
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

### 2.2 Plugin Architecture
- Domain-specific functionality implemented as plugins
- Plugins discovered and loaded dynamically
- Standard interfaces for communication with core system
- Isolation of domain-specific logic

### 2.3 Event-Driven Communication
- Decoupled components communicating via events
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous event handling
- Publishers unaware of subscribers (loose coupling)
- Centralized event bus for message routing

### 2.4 Headless Operation
- All business logic operable without UI
- Clear separation between business logic and presentation
- Command-line interface for automation
- Service APIs for programmatic access

### 2.5 Domain-Driven Design
- Business domains as organizational structure
- Rich domain models with behavior
- Aggregates, entities, and value objects
- Domain events for tracking changes

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Application Orchestrator

        pass

        pass
```

        pass
        
    def export_multiple(self, exports: List[Tuple[CSVExportable, str]], **options) -> List[bool]:
        """Export multiple datasets to CSV files"""
        pass
        
    def export_to_string(self, data: CSVExportable, **options) -> str:
